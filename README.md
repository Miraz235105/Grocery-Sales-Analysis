### Introduction
This project analyzes the 2014 sales data of Prestige Group of Companies to uncover trends, customer behavior, and revenue patterns. The aim is to provide insights that can inform business decisions and improve sales performance. Key datasets include sales transactions, customer details, and shipping information, analyzed using Microsoft Excel tools such as pivot tables and charts.

### Story of Data
This section describes the 2014 sales dataset of Prestige Group of Companies and its journey through the analysis process. The data was sourced from the company's internal sales records and collected from transaction logs. Each row represents a sales transaction, while columns capture variables such as order details, customer information, product category, sales amount, shipping data, and payment type. Key features like customer demographics, product categories, revenue, and regions are critical for identifying sales trends and performance patterns. Potential limitations include missing values, inconsistent entries, and uneven representation across regions or product lines, which may affect the comprehensiveness of the analysis.

### Data Splitting and Preprocessing
The 2014 sales dataset was reviewed to ensure no duplicates, inconsistencies, or missing values were present. Independent variables include Product Name, Category, Region, Salesperson, Payment Type, and Customer Details, while the dependent variable is Revenue, Quantity, Unit Price, and Shipping Fee. Belonging to the retail and e-commerce industry, this analysis is relevant for understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. Key stakeholders include sales, marketing, inventory management, and senior management teams. Insights from the analysis can help optimize product offerings, improve marketing strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance overall profitability.

### Pre-Analysis
In the pre-analysis phase, early exploration of the 2014 sales dataset revealed key trends shaping overall performance. Product category and region emerged as major drivers of revenue, while certain sales representatives consistently appeared in high-value transactions. Seasonal spikes in sales also suggest periods of higher customer demand. Initial observations indicate possible correlations between unit price and revenue, category and quantity sold, regional shipping fees, and payment type with transaction value. Overall, product category, region, pricing, and salesperson effectiveness appear to be the most influential factors, guiding deeper investigation into customer behavior and revenue patterns.

### In-Analysis
**Key Patterns Observed:**
- Certain regions consistently generate higher revenue, suggesting stronger customer demand or better logistical advantages.
- Higher-value orders tend to incur higher shipping fees, hinting at heavier products or premium delivery services.
- Specific product categories appear to dominate revenue, likely due to stronger customer preference or higher unit prices.
- Some orders show longer gaps between order and shipment dates, indicating potential processing or inventory delays.
- Payment types may correlate with larger transactions, though this requires further confirmation.
**Preliminary Recommendations:**
- Improve fulfillment speed in regions or periods with long order-to-shipment delays to enhance customer satisfaction.
- Review and optimize the shipping cost structure, especially for categories consistently linked with high fees.
- Strengthen high-performing regions through better inventory planning, marketing, and delivery support.
- Reassess and expand top-performing product categories to maximize revenue opportunities.
- Examine payment patterns to tailor promotions and streamline the checkout experience.

### Post-Analysis and Insights
**Key Findings:** Based on the completed analysis, several significant insights emerged:
- Revenue performance varies widely across salespersons, with top performers contributing significantly more than low performers.
- Company D emerges as the highest-value customer, while Company K contributes the least, showing strong differences in customer purchasing power.
- The North region leads overall revenue generation, while the West ranks lowest, highlighting clear regional performance gaps.
- New York is the most profitable state and city, outperforming others by a wide margin, with notable gaps of over $26,000–$50,000 when compared to lower-ranking locations.
- A small group of shipping cities - especially New York, Portland, and Miami - drive most of the revenue, while the majority of cities contribute far less.
- Most transactions fall in lower revenue brackets, with transaction frequency decreasing as order value increases.
- Beverages dominate as the top product category, whereas Canned Meat performs the poorest, showing a large revenue gap between category extremes.
- December and Q4 record the highest sales, while February is the weakest month, confirming strong seasonal patterns.
**Comparison with Initial Findings:**
- Early assumptions about strong product categories, high-performing regions, and top salespersons were confirmed through deeper analysis.
- Some surprising insights emerged: a few regions with fewer transactions still produced high revenue due to premium purchases, and certain low-priced categories generated strong revenue through volume.
- Shipping behavior also revealed unexpected efficiency variations, where some low-volume shippers performed better than high-volume ones.

### Data Visualizations & Charts
Visual representations were created in Microsoft Excel to simplify complex data relationships and highlight key patterns related to the delivery status. The Column Chart showed Transaction by Amount, the Pie Chart showed Sales Performance Analysis by Region, the Bar Chart showed Sales Performance Analysis by Reps, Top Five Customers, the Map showed Performance by State, Product Category Performance over Time, Top Six Ship Cities by Revenue, and the Line Chart showed Sales Trend Report.
A consolidated dashboard provides a clear overview of how product categories, regions, salespersons, and shipping metrics contribute to revenue performance, helping stakeholders quickly identify top-performing segments, high-value customers, and areas where operational improvements or strategic interventions are needed.

### Recommendations
**Actionable Insights:**
- Strengthen inventory, promotions, and placement for top-performing product categories like Beverages, while reassessing weaker categories such as Canned Meat.
- Prioritize marketing, distribution, and engagement efforts in underperforming regions and cities to balance revenue performance.
- Introduce bundling, cross-selling, or volume discounts to increase average transaction value, as most sales fall in lower revenue brackets.
- Develop seasonal sales plans and inventory forecasting aligned with revenue peaks and dips.
- Focus on building relationships with high-value customers while exploring growth opportunities in low-performing accounts.
**Optimizations / Business Decisions:**
- Allocate marketing and sales resources to low-performing regions, cities, and product categories.
- Use predictive planning to prepare for high-demand months and mitigate seasonal dips.
- Implement customer segmentation strategies to tailor offers and communication based on customer value.
- Leverage dashboards to track real-time sales trends, regional performance, and monthly revenue variations for timely decision-making.

### Conclusion
The analysis shows that revenue is concentrated in top-performing regions, cities, and product categories, with Beverages, the North region, and New York City leading performance. Most transactions are small-value sales, and a few customers account for a large share of revenue. Limitations include the lack of multi-year data, granular customer or operational information, and contextual factors like promotions. Future research should focus on customer behavior analysis, price sensitivity, promotional impact, predictive forecasting, and exploring growth potential in mid-tier regions and cities.
